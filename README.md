## About Me

Hi! I'm **Arthur Lima**, a passionate developer with a deep interest in creating both dynamic, responsive front-end interfaces and powerful, scalable back-end systems. I strive for perfection in my code and am always eager to learn new technologies to improve my craft.

I focus on building robust systems, creating beautiful and intuitive user experiences, and optimizing performance at every layer. With a keen eye for design and a deep understanding of back-end systems, I bridge the gap between clean, modern front-end and high-performance back-end solutions.

### Current Learning Focus
- Advanced **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, and **Node.js**  
- Scalable back-end systems using **GraphQL** and **REST APIs**  
- Designing modern **front-end interfaces** using **React** and **Next.js**  
- Serverless computing, cloud architectures, and microservices
